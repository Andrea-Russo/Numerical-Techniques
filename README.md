# Numerical Techniques Repository

Welcome to the Numerical Techniques Repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of various numerical techniques for calculus and simulations, meticulously implemented in Python. It serves as a valuable resource for students, educators, and professionals interested in numerical analysis, mathematical modeling, and computational simulations.

## What is Numerical Techniques?

Numerical techniques encompass a broad range of algorithms and methods used for solving mathematical problems numerically. This includes, but is not limited to, solving differential equations, integration, optimization, and linear algebraic equations. These techniques are pivotal in simulations, modeling real-world phenomena, and solving problems where analytical solutions are impractical or impossible.

## Disclaimer

This repository is primarily for educational and practice purposes. The code provided here might not always adhere to the best optimization practices or be extensively commented. However, I strive to maintain clarity and organization throughout. While there is always room for improvement, updates and refinements will be made periodically.

I am also open to collaborations and discussions. If you have ideas, suggestions, or want to contribute, feel free to reach out or submit a pull request.
